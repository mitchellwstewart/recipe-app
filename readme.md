# Recipe App (WIP)


This documentation relates to the in progress development of the Recipe Pals app

## About
Recipe Pals is designed to allow users to add the most important information from their favorite recipes found on external sites. The user can choose to omit lengthy 'life-story' type essays and just save the steps, ingredients, and a general description (including a link to the original recipe). The App allows a user to create, update, and delete recipes as they please. A user can also , "follow" other recipes from other users. Currently, the app accepts a dynamic number of recipe steps and ingredients. The amount of each ingredient will auto update when the `Yields "x" servings` field is updated. Ultimately, each recipe will be able to hold an image gallery updated by the user (currently in progress).

This app uses the following technologies:

- React 
- GraphQL
- MongoDB
