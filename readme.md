# Recipe App (WIP)


This documentation relates to the in progress development of the Recipe Pals app

## About
This Recipe App is designed to allow users to pull in the most important information from their favorite recipes found on externally sites. The user can choose to omit lengthy life-story essays and just save the steps, ingredients, and individual notes (like a link to the original recipe). The App allows a user to create, update, "follow" and delete recipes as they please. Currently, the app accepts a dynamic number of recipe steps and ingredients. The amount of each ingredient will auto update when the `Yields` field is updated. Ultimately, each recipe will be able to hold an image gallery updated by the user (currently in progress)

This app uses the following technologies:

- React 
- GraphQL
- MongoDB
